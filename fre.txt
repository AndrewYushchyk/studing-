The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drink
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too

Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
